Senior Software Engineer with experience building AWS-native cloud infrastructure and deploying Generative AI systems at scale. Proven track record delivering solutions across event-driven cloud platforms, LLM-backed applications, and secure data pipelines.

✅ Cloud & Platform Focus:
 • AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFormation/CDK), Kafka/Confluent
 • Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, serverless architecture, hybrid cloud environments
 • Linux system administration, monitoring (CloudWatch, Prometheus, Grafana)

✅ Generative AI Focus:
 • LLM deployment (OpenAI, Hugging Face, LangChain)
 • Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent orchestration
 • Python backend development (FastAPI, Flask), vector DB integrations

I specialize in building resilient, scalable backend systems that combine the power of cloud-native infrastructure with AI/LLM capabilities.
